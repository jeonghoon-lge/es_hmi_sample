# Chart Sample App

An interactive Flutter chart visualization application showcasing comprehensive data visualization capabilities with advanced animations, accessibility features, and performance optimizations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This Flutter application demonstrates professional-grade data visualization using the fl_chart library with comprehensive state management through Provider pattern. The app features a fully responsive design with smooth animations, accessibility support, and performance optimizations for production-ready deployment.

## ✨ Features

### Chart Visualization
- **5 Chart Types**: Bar, Pie, Line, Stacked Bar, and Donut charts
- **Smooth Animations**: Enhanced chart transitions with fade, scale, and slide effects
- **Interactive Elements**: Touch interactions with tooltips and hover effects
- **Real-time Data Updates**: Live chart updates with optimized performance
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for desktop and mobile devices

### User Controls
- **Dynamic Data Control**: Slider-based real-time data manipulation
- **Color Customization**: 4-color picker system for chart theming
- **Chart Type Switching**: Seamless transitions between different chart types
- **Touch-Optimized**: Gesture-friendly interface design

### Technical Excellence
- **Provider State Management**: Centralized state with performance caching
- **Accessibility Support**: Screen reader compatibility and semantic labels
- **Performance Optimized**: RepaintBoundary, caching, and efficient rebuilds
- **TDD Approach**: Comprehensive test coverage with 139+ passing tests
- **Modern Architecture**: Clean separation with maintainable code structure
