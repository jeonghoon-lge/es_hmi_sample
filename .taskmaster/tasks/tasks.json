        "description": "Define comprehensive unit testing policies and procedures to be implemented as a subtask within each development task, establish test coverage goals, and establish a Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow.",

        "details": "This task involves creating a structured approach to unit testing across the project:\n\n1. Define unit testing standards:\n   - Specify testing frameworks to be used (e.g., Jest, JUnit, pytest)\n   - Establish naming conventions for test files and test cases\n   - Define test organization structure (e.g., mirror source code structure)\n\n2. Set test coverage goals:\n   - Determine minimum code coverage requirements (e.g., 80% line coverage)\n   - Identify critical components requiring higher coverage\n   - Configure code coverage tools and reporting mechanisms\n\n3. Establish TDD workflow:\n   - Document the red-green-refactor cycle process\n   - Create guidelines for writing tests before implementation\n   - Define when to write tests (before, during, or after implementation)\n\n4. Create testing procedures:\n   - Develop checklist for test quality assessment\n   - Establish review process for test code\n   - Define integration with CI/CD pipeline\n   - Ensure each development task includes a 'Unit Test Creation and Execution' subtask\n\n5. Documentation and training:\n   - Create reference documentation for the testing policy\n   - Develop examples of well-written tests\n   - Plan knowledge sharing sessions for the team\n   - Provide templates for unit test subtasks to be included in all future tasks\n\nThe final deliverable will be a comprehensive document outlining the unit testing policy, along with supporting materials such as templates, examples, and integration guides. The policy will specify that all future tasks must include a dedicated 'Unit Test Creation and Execution' subtask rather than creating separate unit testing tasks.",
        "testStrategy": "The implementation of this task can be verified through:\n\n1. Document review:\n   - Ensure the unit testing policy document is complete and covers all required aspects\n   - Verify that test coverage goals are clearly defined and measurable\n   - Confirm TDD workflow is clearly articulated with practical examples\n   - Validate that the policy includes clear guidelines for incorporating unit testing as a subtask\n\n2. Team feedback:\n   - Present the policy to the development team for review\n   - Collect and incorporate feedback from team members\n   - Ensure the policy is understood and accepted by all stakeholders\n\n3. Practical application:\n   - Apply the policy to a sample component or feature\n   - Verify that the policy provides clear guidance in real-world scenarios\n   - Confirm that the defined procedures can be followed without ambiguity\n   - Test the implementation of unit testing as a subtask within a development task\n\n4. Integration verification:\n   - Ensure the policy integrates with existing development processes\n   - Verify compatibility with CI/CD pipeline\n   - Test reporting mechanisms for coverage and test results\n   - Confirm task templates include the required unit testing subtask\n\n5. Success criteria:\n   - Policy document is approved by technical leadership\n   - Team members demonstrate understanding of the policy\n   - Initial implementation shows feasibility and effectiveness of the approach\n   - New tasks are created with the required unit testing subtask",
